Icon Files Needed

This extension requires three icon files:

1. icon16.png - 16x16 pixels (for the extension toolbar icon)
2. icon48.png - 48x48 pixels (for the extension management page)
3. icon128.png - 128x128 pixels (for the Chrome Web Store)

You can create these icons using any image editor. The icons should represent a car or vehicle theme.

For now, you can use placeholder images or create simple icons with text like "Y2" or a car emoji.

To create the icons:
1. Create PNG images with the required dimensions
2. Place them in this icons/ directory
3. Make sure they are named exactly as specified above

The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default puzzle piece icon.
